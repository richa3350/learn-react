Exercises and examples while learning React

First Steps: 
If you haven't used markdown, review a quick basic quide here  https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics. Markdown is a shorthand for creating formatted text content in html. 

React Resources: 
+ Interactive *awesome* getting started tutorial for novice developers at http://buildwithreact.com/tutorial
+ Another helpful and more extensive tutorial here - https://tylermcginnis.com/react-js-tutorial-pt-1-a-comprehensive-guide-to-building-apps-with-react-js-8ce321b125ba#.6sivcy6d6
++ The same author 'Tyler McGinnis' also has a full React course that can be accessed here - http://courses.reactjsprogram.com/courses/reactjsfundamentals/lectures/760301. I found this course helpful with reading material followed by the video to help walk through the lesson.
