About npm
+ Npm is a package manager that helps you package modules. These packages can then be placed into a repository (package library) that can be referred to to install and include any package in your application. An example repo is 'Artifactory' 
+ 'npm install <package_name>' command will reference the configured repository in the .npmrc file, download the requested package inside your projects 'node_moduels' folder. 
+ 'npm install -g <package_name>' command will install the package in a global location. Look up this location with 'npm root -g' 
+ Run 'npm --help' from command line to learn more about npm commands.
